# Click-the-Image-Smartly-using-Opencv
Smart Selfie using OpenCV is an Interface which allows us to click selfies without touching our mobiles or any photo capturing devices. So, in this project we have used OpenCV to do the trick for us, where using the OpenCVâ€™s video capture fucntion and some haarcascade files integrated with flask web framework we have made a smart selfie web application where you can click images without touching any keys on your laptop. The photos are later saved on your device specified directory for later use.
